# Advent of Code 2023 üéÑ

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an yearly event, in the form of an Advent calendar, where you get to solve one problem a day until Christmas. These are my solution for this year and [these]() are my solution for 2022.

## Workflow

Usually, the first day is pretty basic so I use the code from that day as a template. I prefer to not copy the code from the prior year so I can see how my style has changed and what did I learn new :D

This project uses `make` as a build tool so to run the code from a specific day:

```console
$ make DAY=day-01
```

Or if you want to run the project for the current day:

```console
$ make
```

The `input.txt` and `example.txt` have to be inside the specific day folder. For the sake of simplicity, the makefile runs the `main.c` file, which is either part 1 of part 2, I rename the file when I start to work on that part and name it back when I'm done.

Happy coding! ‚ùÑ
