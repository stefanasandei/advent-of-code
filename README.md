# Advent of Code üéÑ

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an yearly event, in the form of an Advent calendar, where you get to solve one problem a day until Christmas.

## Workflow

Usually, the first day is pretty basic so I use the code from that day as a template. I prefer to not copy the code from the prior year so I can see how my style has changed and what did I learn new :D

This project uses `make` as a build tool so to run the code from a specific day:

```console
$ make DAY=01 PART=1
```

Or if you want to run the project for the current day:

```console
$ make
```

The `input.txt` and `example.txt` have to be inside the specific day folder.

Happy coding! ‚ùÑ
